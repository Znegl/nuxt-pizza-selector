# Nuxt Pizza selector

> A pizza selector written in Nuxt, Vue, Vuex and IndexedDB. This is mainly created as a hobby project for testing out Vuex and IndexedDB. It also tries to solve my constant issues selecting the best pizzas.

## Current state

Nothing pizza related really works.
Right now there's only a static page for pizzas with some hardcoded data.

## Progress

* Layout âœ…
* Dark mode (persisted in localStorage) âœ…
* PWA support âœ…
* Fetch initial data from server ðŸ‘Ž
* Vuex ðŸ‘Ž
* Indexed DB 2.0 ðŸ‘Ž
* Offline mode ðŸ‘Ž


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
